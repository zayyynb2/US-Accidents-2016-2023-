# US Accidents (2016-2023)

## Overview
### Traffic Accidents represent a significant  challenge affecting millions of people across the U.S. each year. With the continuous increase in vehicle numbers and expansion of the road network, accidents necessitate research to identify the contributing factors to the rising number of injuries and fatalities. Despite advancements in transportation systems, safety technologies, and the efforts of traffic authorities and specialized agencies, national accident trends indicate a persistent rise in crash rates across many regions.
This project analyzes U.S. traffic accidents from 2016 to 2023 with the objective of identifying the conditions that contribute to higher crash severity. By examining the interaction between time patterns, weather conditions, visibility(mi), distance(mi), and road type, this study provides a comprehensive, data-driven assessment that can inform the development of more effective road-safety policies aimed at reducing accident occurrence and severity.
